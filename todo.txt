# collisions
[ ] implement continuous detection for currently supported shapes

# system update
[x] review the usage of traits for custom types
[x] review the usage of clone(), copied(), *...
[x] implement common methods for custom types (new()...) and replace current usage with them
[x] wrap components around wider components (e.g. Material contains Color, Layer, Show...)

# collisions
[ ] rebuild the collision algorithm
[ ] solve dynamic-dynamic collisions bugs (should be solved with the point above). I believe the bug is caused by dynamic_rect-dynamic_rect continuos collision detection

# rendering
[x] render objects following layers
[ ] implement Display for components

# project management
[ ] add license

# collisions
[ ] stabilize collision detector (hardcode values to counteract approximations)

# system update
[ ] look for optimizations
[ ] better exception handling with Result instead of panic
[ ] refactor code (rename variables and functions, write comments and docstring)

# rendering
[ ] render more complex objects (segment, triangle, polygon)

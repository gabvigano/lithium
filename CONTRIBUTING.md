### 📖 Introduction

Contributions of all kinds are welcome: bug fixes, new features, documentation improvements, or even just trying things out and reporting issues.
Keep in mind the project is **work in progress**, so things may change quickly.

---

### 📦 Requirements

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable recommended)
- Git (to clone and manage branches)
- Linux (tested), Windows (tested), macOS (untested but should work)

---

### 🚀 Getting started

1. clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gabvigano/lithium.git
   cd lithium
   ```
2. run the demo game to make sure everything works:
   ```bash
   cd dropline
   cargo run
   ```

### ✍️ Code style

- format with `cargo fmt` before committing
- lint with `cargo clippy` and fix warnings when possible
- keep commits small and messages **clear**. Use the following syntax:
   ```txt
   add collision detection and rendering to polygons:

   - implement sat check
   - fix hitbox overlap issue
   - add rendering of polygons
   ```
- use only **english** for everything
- write commits and comments in **lowercase**

   ```
2. make your changes and commit them:

   ```
3. push to your fork and open a Pull Request against `main`.
